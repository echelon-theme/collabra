/*
 * Hi! Are you looking to add another style on top of Collabra?
 *
 * This file should probably not be modified directly. Custom changes can be added in
 * a safe way by creating a new file called "_chrome_user.css". This ensures that your
 * changes will not be overwrote by Collabra updates.
 *
 * If you wish to contribute to Collabra, then please contribute changes to the SCSS
 * source, which is put into collabra.css.
